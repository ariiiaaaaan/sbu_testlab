                    Why? Because such a move would undoubtedly hit the aforementioned upsell factor. Apple may try and counter this by making 128GB and 256GB the new mid and top level storage options, but I can still see 32GB proving to be ‘enough’ for many mainstream users. Similarly the knock-on effect of a 128GB midranger would likely make the top end 256GB edition wholly unnecessary for most people.

                    As such the move to 32GB would be a risk. But does Apple have a choice?

                    Personally I’d argue it is no longer credible in 2016 to sell a smartphone with 16GB of storage for $650 and after Apple’s sales hit with the iPhone 6S it may be forced to move with the times.
                    Obviously the latter is the real talking point given the iPhone range has been marooned on 16GB since the iPhone 5 was introduced back in 2012. This is criminal given rivals moved to 32GB years ago and Apple has since introduced a 50% larger camera sensor plus storage hogging Live Photos and 4K video recording to its phones.
